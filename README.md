# Simbolik Example

Welcome to the Simbolik Example repository, your gateway to exploring Simbolik - the Solidity Debugger.

## Getting Started

If you haven't done so yet, follow the steps from our [Getting Started](https://docs.runtimeverification.com/simbolik/overview/getting-started) guide to set up your environment and install the Simbolik VSCode extension.

Once you're set up, open the `test/DebugCPAMM.sol` file in VSCocde.
You'll find a `â–· Debug` button above to the `debugAddLiquidity` and `debugSwap` functions.
Simply click it to start the debugging process.

Happy debugging!
